                Hello! My name is Mangaliso Nkosi I am from Johannesburg, South Africa. I enjoy playing soccer and I'm actually a part of a local soccer team, I also enjoy skating with my friends. I am the first born in my family and I come from a family of four, with that being be me, my parents and my younger brother, we are all members of The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-day Saints. Just a year ago I returned from my full-time missionary service after serving two years in the Botswana/Namibia Mission. When I came back from my mission I worked as an Admin Assistant and served as Ward clerk for my church, in both occupations I used a computer a lot and I was so fascinated by it that I decided to persue a Software Development on BYUI online.
